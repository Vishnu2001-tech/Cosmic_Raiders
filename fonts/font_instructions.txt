PIXEL FONT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=============================

To get the authentic retro arcade look, you need to add a pixel-style font:

OPTION 1 - Download Pixeled Font:
1. Visit: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pixelify+Sans
2. Download the font file
3. Rename it to "Pixeled.ttf"
4. Place it in this fonts/ directory

OPTION 2 - Alternative Pixel Fonts:
- Search for "pixel fonts" or "8-bit fonts" online
- Popular options: "Press Start 2P", "VT323", "Orbitron"
- Save as "Pixeled.ttf" in this directory

OPTION 3 - Use System Font:
- The game will automatically fall back to system font if no custom font is found
- Still looks good but less retro

The game supports these font sizes:
- Title: 48px (main menu title)
- Large: 32px (score, menu options)
- Medium: 24px (subtitles, instructions)
- Small: 16px (detailed instructions)

Once you add the font file, restart the game to see the retro styling!
